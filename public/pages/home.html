                <p>Hi! Welcome to my page :D Online, I go by the name Rata. I'm 17, and I started this site to explore what makes me, me.</p>
                <p>I need to find something to yap about to fill this page with just hold on,,, uh!! I really like this artist called glaive, he's really cool. Especially his ovine hall stuff, and his i care so much that I don't care album. I love him!! I also really like so many other artists, my music taste is very diverse :></p>
                <p>I write poetry, sometimes!! My poetry collection is on another site (<a href="https://aforest.neocities.org/">here</a>). I use poetry as a means of self-exploration and venting, the poems are usually messy and weird and a tad too much for me to post, but I do anyways! I love writing them, but I love reading them even more, it's a nice reminder of my former self :D</p>
                <p>Anyways, enjoy the site!! Go check out my diary, its kinda nice. Also, my sewing projects and other stuff!!!</p>
