                <p>Today was a nice day :) I went to Glasgow for the open uni day and it was nice, I went to a philosophy lecture, it was really interesting, I also met this girl there and she was nice! We had lunch and then I had to go back home cuz I had to go to therapy.</p>
                <p>Therapy was super productive, I delved into what I was talking about on the last entry, about my growth and how there are still things I need to grow past.</p>
