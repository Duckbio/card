                <p>I had quite a nice day today, just hanged out with my friends and got some work done :D</p>
                <p>While walking to school I was wondering whether or not I've changed in the past couple months, especially since my failures in my past relationship. I didn't quite have an answer then, but this evening while showering I was thinking about it and I realised that I have changed, maybe not substantially, but I do think I have become a lot more mature in my thinking.</p>
                <p>The reason why I realised this is because I was envisioning myself dating someone and I couldn't for the life of me tell them I loved them (in my daydream) and that is a stark contrast to the relationship I was in, where I was so very fast in saying I love you. I think I've grown past idealisation and desperate attempts at replacing the loneliness with <i>anyone</i>. Instead I think I've grown to a point where I choose my relationships based on compatiblity rather than attraction and desperation.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, I have developed myself past self-destruction, especially recently. I no longer feel a reliance on a lover for healing and inner peace, instead I now view the prospect of a partner as a cherry on top, rather than the whole cake.</p>
                <p>I'm very grateful for the past two months, the months after breaking up with my first love. They have been <strong>very</strong> hellish, but by living in that self-imposed torment I managed to find an answer to a lot of questions about my being and what I expect from life and others. In those two months, I engaged in very self-destructive actions (drinking, smoking, shutting myself off, self-harm etc.) and from that I learnt to nurture myself instead; in those two months I had convinced myself that the only way to save myself was through a new relationship, I was envisiong a practical repeat of the one I had just come out of, and at the end of that I realised that self-love and getting in a relationship out of true desire to share a life with someone, rather than sheer desperation, is the much healthier option.</p>
                <p>Not to say that I didn't value my girlfriend at the time, I did care for her deeply. It's just that at the time I was not yet developed enough as a person, in terms of branching myself out beyond the relationship and in terms of what I viewed a relationship to be, to handle the love with maturity and care. Furthermore, I can't deny that I think part of the reason we started dating was because of a shared desperation to share the warmth of another, and I think that set a basis of false expectation and romantisaction that set the prelude for what was to come, which was conflict and different wavelength of thinking.</p>
                <p>I'm so very grateful that she came into my life, because she taught me a lot about myself and she did change me for the better. I am also grateful that we made the choice to leave eachother, because it allowed for my self-growth. Lastly, I'm grateful that she did not accept my apology, because it led to a true desire for me to change and a true need for introspection, through which I found the words I am writing right now.</p>
                <p>I'm looking forward to the future and what is in store, which are words I don't think I have ever muttered before.</p>
                <p>My daily recommendation is... solace remix - sniper2004 (he just released it soo!!) ♡</p>
