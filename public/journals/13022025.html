                <p>hi, apologies for the lack of entries. I've been quite lazy this past week lol.</p>
                <p>I've just been procrastinating studying, even tho I have my mocks in a few days. I've literally just been grinding hypixel skyblock the whole time, barely touched a textbook.</p>
                <p>Not much has happened otherwise, I went out with a friend and thats kind of it.</p>
                <p>I've been really depressed today, maybe thats why I decided to write, cuz I've actually been somewhat happy this past week. I guess when I'm happy I tend to just shut up and enjoy things, but when I'm sad I feel the need to write it down.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure why I'm sad, I guess I just feel kind of lonley and empty, the usual really. I'm still thinking about her, I guess it's kind of different though; like it's less I wish we could go back to what was, and more 'I know that we will never talk again, let alone love one another, and that hurts so much'.</p>
                <p>Not much more to say, though, so bye!!</p>
                <p>My song recommendation for the day is... Blondie by Current Joys (I cried in my bed listening to this)♡</p>
