                <p>I read my peoms out loud for the first time in my life. I always write them using my internal voice, and I never thought to actually read them out loud, so I tried and I read out a few of them. At first, it felt weird and I struggled to find the pacing, that my mind so easily created, through the rise and fall of my lungs. But, the more I read, the more I got enveloped by the emotions of the poems.</p>
                <p>I could almost feel the same emotions that I felt when writing them, and, as they took hold of me, my voice grew raspier and raspier, grew more shallow in sound, yet ever so heavier in inflection. My eyes teared up, and, with every word that I read out, I felt every single memory and emotion that went into it. I could feel the tears form in my throat, and, as I said the last word of each poem, I almost felt as if that part of me left the cell of my mind and could fly freely, for every soul to gaze at freely.</p>
                <p>It was nice.</p>
