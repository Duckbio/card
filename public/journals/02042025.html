                <p>Today was such a busy day omlll... I went rock climbing for the first time in a good while, I missed doing it! It was fun, I climbed with this guy I met there and it was nice talking to someone new c:</p>
                <p>Then I went and had lunch with my grandmother and after that I went litter-picking for a volunteering thingy. Then I went for a bike ride for like 1hr and finallly got home and relaxed.<p>
                <p>I also got a really nice email in regards to my poetry site!!! The sender said they loved the poems, and they said "your prose reminds me of cold sea waves, calmly washing onto the shore", "I think you could write some amazing material on the sea".</p>
                <p>So I did!! I think it's my best work (maybe better than the sonnet I wrote a while back)!!! But I'm gatekeeping it <:) Only myself and the dear sender of the email will ever see it <:)</p>
                <p>So if u want a poem u better send me a cute email at <i>rataduck@proton.me</i></p>
                <p>My song recommendation of the day is... i want someone so badly by Jeff Buckley ♡</p>
