                <p>Loneliness is a torture that nothing else matches. Love is a supposed escape from it, but I've found that the loneliness follows me into it with no regard for reality. Friendship is a nice solace from it, but it's but a temporary bandaid; the moment I step foot into my room the loneliness envelopes me once again.</p>
                <p>I very sadly see no end to it, if I'm lonely when I have no lover and if I'm lonely when I have someone to hold me, then what am I to do? I've tried to find an escape from it through self-love, but it hasn't solved much, at least not yet.</p>
                <p>What do I do then?</p>
                <p>One of my best friends ghosted me, I'm not sure why. I think that's why I've been feeling extra alone these past few days. The last thing I sent her was this poem I wrote, she asked me what the inspiration was and I sent her a rant about it, haven't heard from her since.</p>
                <p>Poetry has been a form of escape for me, but it's made so many people leave my life. After we broke up, my ex read my poems about a girl who wasn't her and came to hate me and now my best friend, maybe coincidentally, ghosted me after sending her the poem.</p>
                <p>It's hard to express yourself without sending the wrong message, especially in poetry. The poems about the other girl weren't about the other girl, but instead my growth from the experience I had, but all my ex saw was that I was in love with her, which was simply untrue. I'm not sure what my best friend saw in that poem that she disliked, maybe the timing was coincidental.</p>
                <p>I've been smoking a lot recently, it provides a temporary escape from life, but it also reinforces the feelings of despair when the cravings come in. I find that they're like my relationship with love, it provides an escape, but also makes me incredibly addicted.</p>
                <p>I always crave appreciation. I've never been open to my parents, but one time I showed my despair to my mom and in response she said 'I know why you're so sad, you are a person that finds happiness in people appreciating you, but you don't get appreciated enough'. That was a truth bomb that changed my perception on things quite a lot, but I'm not sure how to find appreciation. I do find that a lot of people appreciate me, but maybe not in the way I want them to. People read my poems, but they rarely see the words for what they are. People appreciate my strengths, but they never quite appreciate what I truly care about.</p>
                <p>I miss being appreciated. I miss love, in its purely physical expression. I miss memories of her. I miss a lot, maybe I should start appreciating the moment, instead of missing it once it's gone.</p>
