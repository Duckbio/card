                <p>Today was another good day, the spring buff is coming in hard <:)</p>
                <p>I had school and it was usual, spoke with my friends and all that. Had a guitar lessons, its been ages since the last one; it's going well tho, slowly improving :D</p>
                <p>OH MY GOD YEAH THE BEST FUCKING SONG EVER RELEASED!!! ITS UK BITCHES BY GLAIVE!! ITS SO GOOD. I heard a small snippet of it like 8 months ago and I've been craving the full version since, I'm so glad it released!! It carries cute memories as well, it was the only glaive song my ex liked and we jammed to it together a few times <3</p>
                <p>So, obviously, my music recommendation for today is... uk bitches by glaive w/ kurtains ♡</p>
