                <p>Today was the best day of my life!</p>
                <p>I went to Glasgow at 12pm for the glaive concert, which started at 1900. I had sushi and then I walked around for 4 hours looking for glaive lmao, apparently some fans found him chilling in the park but I went looking somewhere else so I didn't find him :(</p>
                <p>Then I went around looking for sewing needles cuz I had to sew a patch I had bought, it took like 2 hours to find a fucking needle oml.</p>
                <p>Whatever though, then I went to queue for the concert, I got there 1 hour early so I wasn't too deep into the queue. In front of me was this really cute guy and a girl (we'll call them Ryan and Lily) and I decided to talk to them! I complimented the guys fit and we got to talking, they were really cool so I hanged out with them the rest of the night!</p>
                <p>When we got in we got close to front row and then kurtains started opening and it was soo hype omg. It was the first proper concert I've been to and to see on of my fav artists just walk up on stage, mere metres away from me, was sick!!! Unfortunately cuz he was the opener not many people fucked with him, but me and Ryan vibed so hard, he loves kurtains a lot so it was fun!</p>
                <p>Then glaive pulled up on stage AND HOLY SHIT MAN<  << SaDnsand sadnas IT WAS INSANE</p>
                <p>I SAW HIM IN REAL LIFE LIKE WHAT?!?!?!!?!!? MY FAV ARTIST, THE GUY WHOS MUSIC HAS KEPT ME GOING THROUGH EVERYTHInG!?!? ?LIKE OMG</p>
                <p>The concert was sick, we did a few mosh pits and I met so many cool people <33333</p>
                <p>After the concert me, Lily and Ryan decided to wait just in case glaive would come out. We waited with a bunch of other people (who we spoke to while waiting, they were all so cool) for like 45 minutes but in the end he came out oh my god!!!! He signed Ryans homemade 'a bit of a mad one' CD and he signed Lily's vinyl for ICSMTIDCA. Then he fucking signed my tshirt and he hugged me !!!N !NJD!!!!! OGMGGGG OMGGG OMGGG OMGGG LIKE. I HUGGED. HIM. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa</p>
                <p>After glaive left I went to sleep over at a friends place, he made me some lentils and we sat around with his boyfriend and chatted until 1 am, then I fell asleep</p>
                <p>Best day of my life, by far.</p>
