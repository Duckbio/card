                <p>I feel alone and empty. I've been using substance abuse as a means to escape it, but it hasn't really helped, it's just given me another worry (health). 6.5/10 would maybe recommend it to someone who's depressed.</p>
                <p>I don't know why I feel like this. I want to be able to just appreciate life as it is, but for some reason I can't. Is it lack of hobbies? Is it lack of friendship? Lack of love, maybe? Lack of appreciation? What am I lacking?</p>
                <p>I can't figure it out, all I know is what my brain thinks it desires to fix it, whether it craves love, attention or a cigarette. I know none of these fix the problem, at least they haven't in the past, so, then, what is it I can do?</p>
                <p>I'm so very tired of living like this, every day but another one filled with boredom and desire for more.</p>
                <p>Can someone come save me, please?</p>
                <p>My daily recommendation is... May's minuet by Niwamori Piano ♡</p>
