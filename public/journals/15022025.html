                <p>Today was a nice day!! I went out in Glasgow with my best friend and we had such a nice time, ate some pizza, spoke about life, gossiped and all that shit. 10//10 day</p>
                <p>Sorry for the lack of updates recently, my life has gotten somewhat routinely and I have little to write about, nowadays I've just been addicted to minecraft and been studying for my exams. Plus, I am in a mentally good place at the moment, so no random rants about anything :(</p>
                <p>I'll try to adjust and maybe try find some other things to write about? I'll figure it out! Weekly updates could work, or maybe I could focus more on writing about hobbies and learnings?</p>
                <p>okayy thats ittt for today tho bai bai</p>
                <p>My recommendation for the day is... denial by kurtains ♡</p>
