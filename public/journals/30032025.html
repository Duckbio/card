                <p>Today was a nice day :) I went to church with my grandmother, helped her move some stuff and then played guitar and did some sewing :)</p>
                <p>I've been thinking a lot about my growth these past months. I think that I've grown a lot since I started keeping this journal, I think I've grown a lot in my ability to make sense of and deal with my emotions. I think I have also matured, at least a bit, especially in my approach to relationships and friendship. I certainly still have a lot more to learn, but this journal, introspection and therapy have helped a lot :D</p>
