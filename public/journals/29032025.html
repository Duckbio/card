                <p>So today has actually been really good! The first day of being fully alone, and even tho my wifi went out for most of the day for some reason, I still was doing well. I didn't get to sew or anything, but I played some guitar, spoke to friends and coded a bit.</p>
                <p>My friend from Gaza texted me for the first time since Oct 7th, I'm so fucking glad he's alive. We spoke for 2 hours about the situation and he sent me a bunch of videos. I'm praying for his safety. He's a strong man, I'm glad he's surviving the genocide <3</p>
