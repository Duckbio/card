                <p>Today was honestly such a good day!!</p>
                <p>I hanged out with my best friend and we just listened to music and chilled out, smoked a cheeky cigarette together :D I vented to him about my past relationships, idk what got into me, but I did. Its the first time I've really spoken about my feelings to someone in a while and it felt somewhat liberating. I spoke about my past experiences with them and how confusing it's all been, but also how different my perspectives and approaches to them have been. I also realised that I have grown a lot in terms of how I view other people, especially partners.</p>
                <p>Then, I spoke with the friend I reconnected with. Well, okay I gotta admit something! This friend is actually the girl a lot of my poems were about. We've become friends now and it's been very nice talking to her again. I've been seeing a part of her she never showed me when we were part of eachother's lives before. She showed me some of her peoms and oh my god. They were some of the most beautiful works I've seen, it was so impressive to see. They were so beautifully written and so emotionally heavy, yet the words also felt like a liberating weightlessness. She's also shown me her other artistic projects and goals and it's made me remember how much we have in common. Like, we're both into fashion design, we both write poetry, we both play guitar etc. etc. I'm glad we can be friends, I appreciate we've been able to grow past what we were.</p>
                <p>I also started working on a new sewing project and it's actually going so well!!! I usually always fuck something up and I dont wanna jinx anything, butttt it's been going perfectly!!</p>
                <p>I went to sleep with a smile on my face.</p>
