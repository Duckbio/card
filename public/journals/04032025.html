                <p>Today was such a stressful day... I had to travel a couple hours to go see a therapist, my first therapy session in a while. It went well, I maybe was a little too open for the first session and I trauma dumped on the poor woman, but it was okay. She was concerned about my well-being to the degree that she said I need to go see a psychiatrist, so now I have to find go find one :/</p>
                <p>It was so exausthing travelling to go see her as well, when I got home I was so exausthed I just got really depressesd and sat in my bed until I fell asleep.</p>
                <p>No music today... ♡</p>
