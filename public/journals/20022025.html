                <p>a sonnet to your pretty eyes</p>
                <pre>
I woke up and saw your eyes, so stunning 
The raging ocean upon your iris,
lined by beams of speckled light violent,
maybe deep inside your love was lurking.

Their blueish tint and your soft blonde lashes,
the way they smiled at me as I kissed you,
as I traced my hands around your purlieu,
made me burn so bright and turn to ashes.

I fell so in love when I first saw them,
your pretty lips but a small pallet:
a mere facet to the deep blue droplets,
which to see close I so deeply wanted.

Your dear eyes are the ones I so much miss,
as they reached in me, leaving me in bliss.
