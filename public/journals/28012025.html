                <p>I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.... but I recovered!!! I hanged out with a friend of mine for a couple hours and she played some piano for me, she plays really beautifully and it was so nice to be soothed by the notes bouncing around the room. I tried to play her some guitar, but the moment I picked it up I literally forgot every song I've ever learnt and it was so embarassing LOLLL</p>
                <p>But, then, we studied together for another hour and then I went home and had a beer or two and then I did some sewing AND OH MY GOD. I FINALLY FUCKING GOT IT, I FINALLY MANAGED TO LEARN HOW TO WORK MY STUPID SEWING MACHINE AND I DID MY FIRST PROPER STITCH WHERE I CLOSED THE SIDE SEAM OF A PAIR OF JEANS YAYYYYY</p>
                <p>Today has been a day centered around music, from the piano she played me to the songs she showed me to laying in bed with a nic patch in my mouth listening to Frank Ocean. So I don't have only one song to recommend, I have a couple!</p>
                <p>My many recommendations for today are: acne by kurtains, ivy by frank ocean, last night I dreamt that somebody loved me by The Smiths, kisses by Slowdive, Kingston by Faye Webster, and, finally, Chocolate and Mint by Duster♡</p>
