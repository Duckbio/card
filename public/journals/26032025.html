                <p>SORRY FOR DISAPPEARING I WAS SO LAZY LMAOOO</p>
                <p>I HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY THO!!!! OKay so after the concert I kept on talking to the people I met and they invited me to go to London with them to the next glaive concert!! So I impulse bought a flight to London and we went!!</p>
                <p>It was sick!!! We met in Camdem Town and we went shopping together, I found this really cool tshirt and my friend bought a bunch of sick stuff. The queue for the concert was crazy though, Glasgow had people queueing 1hr before, but in London there were people there 9 hours early.</p>
                <p>My friend went and queued like 4 hours early, but myself and the others went into the queue like 30 min before the start, so we ended up at the veryy back fo the pit :(</p>
                <p>Kurtains was a sick opener and we vibed so hard!! Then me and this guy I met in the queue went and smoked and he introduced me to some sick hyperpop artists!! Then, we made it out mission to get through the crowd and reach barriers</p>
                <p>We tried pushing through people before glaive started, but like 5 min in I look next to me and a whole ass fight starts D: It was crazy though, it was a proper fucking fight, they were on the floor throwing punces and my friend got dragged into it. I thought my friend had started it and so I was not fucking with getting involved, so I used it as an opportunity to get in front</p>
                <p>I sprinted through the crowd and got like halfway, then glaive came in and AGAIN OMGG!!!</p>
                <p>Okay so the whole concert was sick, I met and vibed with so many people in the crowd and it was amazingg!!! I managed to get to barriers as well and it was so fun there, the real fans were there and we vibed together so much!!!!</p>
                <p>Then at the end of the concert a moshpit started and I went in and I kept on noticing this really pretty girllll</p>
                <p>At the very end of the concert we like locked eyes and started vibing!! I pulled out my phone and gave it to her with insta opened, so while we were in the middle of the mosh trying to survive she was writing in her insta lol</p>
                <p>We ended up staying together after the concert ended and I met her friend, we decided to go clubbing together and shit but I am 17 so yeah that didn't happen. BUTTT we still hung out together, we went to a store and bought some water cuz I was dying of thirst, it was rlly fun cuz like I was acting like a fiend for water of all things and when I finally got some I said 'im boutta be like badlandschugs in this bitch' and chugged a litre in about 30 seconds. SHE GOT THE REFERENCE THO, I DIDNT THINK ANYONE WOULD EVER REMEMBER WHO TF BADLANDSCHUGS IS LOLL</p>
                <p>Then we went back to the concert venue and hung out with the people staying there after the concert ended, I met the guy who was in the fight and my friend, the one who was also in the fight. I also saw my friend, the one who originally invited me to London. The five of us (me, the girl, her friend, my friend and the OG friend) left and decided to go street drinking</p>
                <p>It was so fun!!! And honestly me and that girl were kindaaa flirting and shit I think!?!? We were holding hands and hugging and around eachother the whole night sooo <3</p>
                <p>That concert night was the best day of my life!!!</p>
                <p>Then uhhh yeah the rest of the past 2 weeks has been kinda uneventful, I've been going to therapy and that has lowkey helped so much, I've actually felt really happy and content these past few weeks, I think this is the longest I've felt good for in my life</p>
                <p>Also I'm going to go see that girl at the end of april!! She's a singer and she invited me to her concert!!! I'm so excited!!</p>
