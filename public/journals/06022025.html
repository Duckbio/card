                <p>Do you ever see someone that does something so well you feel a sense of defeat? Like, you know you will never ever create something as good as their work, or you'll never play as well, or you'll never make a song as good. I found this fashion desginers instagram today called @horsgorl and their work is amazing, the image selection, the placement, the blending of materials, the proportions, the material choice itself. Just wow.</p>
                <p>In a way, it makes me want to give up. I will never make something as good as their worst work, let alone their best. But, in the same time, it motivates me so much to try so much harder, prove the haters wrong yknow?</p>
                <p>Today was a good day, I didn't get any work done, even though I was hoping to, but I spent time with friends and worked on the website (big updates coming your way soon! :D). So, all in all, good day!!</p>
                <p>I hanged out with a friend of mine for a couple hours, she's one of the most impressive people I know! She's crazy studious, she studies like 8 hours a day, I always warn her that she'll burn out, but she never listens lol. She has really good taste in music as well!! And she showed me her art collage today, it was very pretty and the drawings were so impressive, like wow!!! She's really cool, also so fucking pretty it's like seeing an angel :></p>
                <p>It's a little earlier then when I usually write my entries, barely 5pm, so I'm gonna outline what I'm planning on doing the rest of the day: practice guitar, working on my sewing project and study a bit more!</p>
                <p>Todays recommendation is: Solo by Frank Ocean ♡</p>
