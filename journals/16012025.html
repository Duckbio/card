                <p>I finally got a good nights sleep. I think things are looking up, for now, I don't feel as emotionally distressed and while I'm still thinking about her so often, I don't feel as awful anymore.</p>
                <p>I went to see a doctor about my mental health and he told me there's not much they can do, the wait time to see a psychologist/psychiatrist is 2 years and after that it'd take another year to get a diganosis and medication. So, it seems I just have to continue fighting this feeling on my own :`)</p>
                <p>I finally managed to open up to one of my friends, as I've been keeping these feelings to myself and this diary for so long. I don't feel particularly better, but it still felt nice to heard and I'm sure that if I keep being open like this, things will get better <3</p>
                <p>My daily recommendation is... Evangeline by Cocteau Twins ♡/p>
