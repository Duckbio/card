                <p>I had my first day of school today and it was actually quite nice, it was so nice seeing my friends again :)</p>
                <p>Though it also sucks cuz its so boringgggg... I just wanna be able to go home after lessons end man...</p>
                <p>Otherwise, nothing much has happened ngll. I've reconnected with an old friend of mine and it's been such a great feeling, I think she's the only person that kind of gets my 'deeper' side and it feels so nice to be open like I am with her. Though its also scary, because I still have this feeling that being open leads to people leaving me. I've come to realise that it wasn't the being open that led to people leaving me in the past, it was my actions that came with being open.</p>
                <p>ALSOO!! I'VE BEEN BUMPING GLAIVE SO MUCH HES ACTUALLY MY GOAT PLS GO CHECK HIM OUT <3333 I should make an album dump with all my fav artists and songs, I'm planning on printing them out and sticking them to my wall</p>
