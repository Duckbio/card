                <p style="overflow: visible;">Coding has always been a huge part of my life since I was a child; I began my journey when I was 12 when I was introduced to coding by a senior at my school. From there, I ventured into many different parts, from a short lived game dev phase to spending almost a year making a discord bot to track my scores on a game called osu! From there, I spent a year working on small-scale projects that were useful to my friends and I, but then I got interested in web development, in which I spent around 8 months working on a project in React (of which I don't want to look back on (I was in a very cringy phase)). Unfortuantely, after that, I lost interest in coding due to a lack of ideas for new projects. However, I hope that with this website I can get back into it and find something I love :) So, with that, I am currently working on:</p>
